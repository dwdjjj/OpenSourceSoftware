## ✨Changing skeleton code✨

> First, I added timer following this lecture.
> if chaser turtle tries to get out of the screen, reset (0,0)
> if runner turtle tries to get out of the screen, move it backward and turn around.
> runner turtle will be slow down by speed function. It is used by division.
> because of easy level.
> And I hope plus Fly object, but I failed it.
> Before the end of this semester, I want to continue touching this turtle game code to learn Python grammar and add some functions.
